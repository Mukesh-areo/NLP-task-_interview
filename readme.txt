Create a ML model for the given dataset with supervised learning approach. 
1. DO EDA of dataset. 
2. Embedding/normalization/dimension reduction (any approach depends on your approach)
3. Use various learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, decision tree, etc to create a model
4. use 80-20 train test split to find the accuracy 
5. show the result of accuracy, f1, recall, precision for each class
6. Include confusion matrix result for both training and test data
---------------------------------------------
problem 1
Given dataset named dataset_1.csv has 4 features and target. 

problem 2
Given dataset named dataset_2.csv has 6 features and target. 

Problem 3:
dataset named dataset_3.csv had title, abstract and first claim columns as features and a target lable.
Use tf-idf embedding or any embedding of your choice and create the model.  

Problem 4:
dataset named dataset_4.csv had title, abstract and first claim columns as features and a target lable.
Use tf-idf embedding or any embedding of your choice and create the model.

Note:

please note that how you approch the problem and analyse and solve is more important than getting high accuracy.
you can use any source from internet and solve the problem. 
Avoid getting help from friends or making others solve the problem. You will be asked to explain your work during next round video call interview.  

Good luck.
